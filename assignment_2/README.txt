If in a Unix terminal, you can run all scripts automatically by calling "./runall.sh < <filename.ext>".

If you're not a weird person and don't use WSL, you can run each script using "python <script name> < <filename.ext>".

The least-squares algorithm used currently only uses weights equal to unity (will try to change this later).
