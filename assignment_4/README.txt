Made with Conda Python 3.11.5.

If in a Unix terminal, you can run all scripts automatically by calling "./runall.sh <file for problem_5.py>" (may need to run "chmod +x runall.sh" in case uploading to Canvas changed something).

Otherwise, you can run each script using "python3 <script>", supplying the file for problem_5.py when executing it.

Problems 2 and 4 are just includes for the other problems, as per the problem statements. No driver code here.
