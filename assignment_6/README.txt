Made with Conda Python 3.11.5.

If in a Unix terminal, you can run all scripts automatically by calling "./runall.sh" (you may need to run "chmod +x runall.sh" in case uploading to Canvas changed its executable permissions).

Otherwise, you can run each script using "python3 <script>".

problem_4.py takes an extremely long amount of time to run (> 5 hours), because of it not being multithreaded, so you probably don't want to run it. Didn't have time to parallelize it though. To terminate a script from the terminal, press CTRL + C.
